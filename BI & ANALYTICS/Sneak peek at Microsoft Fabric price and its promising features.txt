Microsoft has made good on its promise to deliver a simplified and more efficient Microsoft Fabric price model for its end-to-end platform designed for analytics and data workloads. Based on the total compute and storage utilized by customers, the company’s new pricing structure eliminates the need for separate payment for compute and storage buckets associated with each of Microsoft’s multiple services.

This strategic move lights up the competition with major rivals like Google and Amazon, who offer similar analytics and data products but charge customers multiple times for various discrete tools employed on their respective cloud platforms.

Microsoft Fabric price is about to be announced

Although we do not have official Microsoft Fabric price data, which will be shared tomorrow, VentureBeat shared the average prices that Microsoft will charge for this service, and it is as follows:

Stock-Keeping Units (SKU) Capacity Unit (CU) Pay-as-you-go at US West 2 (hourly) Pay-as-you-go at US West 2 (monthly) F 2 2 $0.36 $262.80 F 4 4 $0.72 $525.60 F 8 8 $1.44 $1,1051.20 F 16 16 $2.88 $2,102.40 F 32 32 $5.76 $4,204.80 F 64 64 $11.52 $8,409.60 F 128 128 $23.04 $16,819,2 F 256 256 $46.08 $33,638.40 F 512 512 $92.16 $67,276.80 F 1024 1024 $184.32 $134,553.60 F 2048 2048 $368.64 $269,107.20

As you can see in the table, the Microsoft Fabric price is shaped to deliver the service your company needs with minimum expenditure by choosing a way that you will pay as much as you use according to the quantity of SKU and CU you will use and not on a fixed price of the service you receive.

Especially for small businesses, we think that this kind of payment plan is much more accurate and a good step to ensure equality in the market because similar services in the market are not very accessible, especially on a low budget.

Microsoft’s unified pricing model for the Fabric suite marks a significant advancement in the analytics and data market. With this model, customers will be billed based on the total computing and storage they utilize.

This eliminates the complexities and costs associated with separate billing for individual services. By streamlining the pricing process, Microsoft is positioning itself as a formidable competitor to industry leaders such as Google and Amazon, who have repeatedly charged customers for different tools employed within their cloud ecosystems.

It is a fact that the Microsoft Fabric price will differentiate it from other tools in the industry because, normally, when you buy such services, you are billed for several services that you do not really use. The pricing Microsoft offers your business is a bit unusual.

All you need in one place

So is the Microsoft Fabric price the tech giant’s only plan to stay ahead of the data game? Of course not!

Microsoft Fabric suite integration brings together six different tools into a unified experience and data architecture, including:

Azure Data Factory

Azure Synapse Analytics Data engineering Data warehouse Data science Real-time analytics

Power BI

This consolidation within the Microsoft Fabric price you will pay allows engineers and developers to seamlessly extract insights from data and present them to business decision-makers.

Microsoft’s focus on integration and unification sets Fabric apart from other vendors in the market, such as Snowflake, Qlik, TIBCO, and SAS, which only offer specific components of the analytics and data stack.

This integrated approach provides customers with a comprehensive solution encompassing the entire data journey, from storage and processing to visualization and analysis.

The contribution of Power BI

The integration of Microsoft Power BI and Microsoft Fabric offers a powerful combination for organizations seeking comprehensive data analytics and insights. Together, these two solutions work in harmony, providing numerous benefits:

This combination enables organizations to unlock the full potential of their data and make data-driven decisions with greater efficiency and accuracy.

Centralized data lake for all your data troubles

At the core of Microsoft Fabric lies the centralized data lake, known as Microsoft OneLake. OneLake is designed to store a single copy of data in a unified location, leveraging the open-source Apache Parquet format.

This open format allows for seamless storage and retrieval of data across different databases. By automating the integration of all Fabric workloads into OneLake, Microsoft eliminates the need for developers, analysts, and business users to create their own data silos.

This approach not only improves performance by eliminating the need for separate data warehouses but also results in substantial cost savings for customers.

Flexible compute capacity

One of the key advantages of Microsoft Fabric is its ability to optimize compute capacity across different workloads. Unused compute capacity from one workload can be utilized by another, ensuring efficient resource allocation and cost optimization. Microsoft’s commitment to innovation is evident in the addition of Copilot, Microsoft’s chatbot powered by generative AI, to the Fabric suite.

Copilot enables developers and engineers to interact in conversational language, simplifying data-related tasks such as querying, data flow creation, pipeline management, code generation, and even machine learning model development.

Moreover, Fabric supports multi-cloud capabilities through “Shortcuts,” allowing virtualization of data lake storage in Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage, providing customers with flexibility in choosing their preferred cloud provider.
