Tech layoffs 2022 include tech giants like Amazon, Twitter, and Meta. What’s worse is that as the year comes to a close, it appears that there will be even more. Layoffs began after a successful year for technology in 2021. In 2022, 795 tech companies laid off 121,667 employees and, unfortunately, still counting.

The core engines of the sector have traditionally been the North American technology sector. The U.S. tech sector has been a consistent source of rising stocks and comfortable, well-paying jobs for over 20 years. The boot is now on the other foot. Let’s examine the circumstances that led to the tech layoffs 2022, how they came about, and what will occur in the future.

Tech layoffs 2022: The reasons

Numerous businesses that have made public statements have mentioned at least one of two main reasons:

During the epidemic, when people were very online, they employed a lot of staff. Now that the online boom has subsided and actual life has resumed, those new hires appear too expensive.

Brands are now less willing to invest in digital advertising, a source of income for many online companies, due to broader economic uncertainty. The cheap-money age of venture capital has ended due to high-interest rates.

Is COVID-19 causing tech layoffs? As we mentioned above, starting of COVID-19 is not driving the situation. As a matter of fact, the fading effects of the pandemic call forth the tech layoffs 2022. With the chart below, You can check the tech layoffs since COVID-19.

So, how did we get here? Big Tech businesses have just posted less-than-stellar earnings. Still, they have also given off warning indications about the coming months. Companies claimed that customers were cutting down on their spending because a recession was imminent. There were few indications that things would soon turn around. This indicates that those businesses and more will also look for cost-cutting opportunities in the upcoming weeks and months.

The pandemic, which encouraged the boom, has now ended for the tech industry. What’s taking place right now is sort of a correction as the IT industry readjusts to a period when people aren’t cooped up at home, glued to their devices.

What’s happening now? Tech layoffs 2022 continue at full pace. Just in November, 83 tech companies such as Coinbase, Spotify, Meta, and Twitter laid off their employees due to economic challenges, which made this month worst in terms of layoffs.

Consumer-related tech companies took the biggest hit with food and transportation. It makes sense when we think about how the pandemic affects us. At the beginning of it, we were at home, ordered food online, and kept away from public transportation.

Asana is the latest company to lay off its employees.

Tech companies that have slowed or frozen hiring

Layoffs are not the only solution to take precautions. Some companies slowed or froze hiring, which is also bad for the sector. These are the tech companies that have slowed or frozen hiring:

Microsoft

Nvidia

Lyft

Uber

Salesforce

Meta

Spotify

Google

Apple

Tech layoffs 2022 also started to freeze the tech industry’s hiring trend.

Microsoft

In late May, Microsoft reduced hiring for its Teams, Office, and Windows software divisions. These teams only experience the slowdown because of recent growth. As the start of the new fiscal year draws near, a Microsoft spokesperson told Bloomberg that the company is “making sure the right resources are aligned to the right opportunity.” The company cut numerous job postings on July 20, including those in its cloud and security business units.

Nvidia

In its earnings call in May, Nvidia announced that hiring would slow down in the latter part of the year. According to Nvidia, the decision is being made “to focus our budget on caring for existing employees as inflation persists.”

Tech layoffs 2022:

Lyft

Lyft announced in May that it would slow down hiring to concentrate on key open positions. In a memo to the staff, company president John Zimmer stated that cost-cutting measures would be taken due to “an economic slowdown and the dramatic change in investor sentiment.”

Uber

In response to a “seismic shift” in the market, Uber is reducing hiring and other expenses, according to an email CEO Dara Khosrowshahi sent to staff. According to Khosrowshahi, hiring should be considered a “privilege,” and the business will reduce its “least efficient” marketing and incentive costs. In the middle of September, it shut down its office in Vilnius, Lithuania.

Salesforce

In May, Salesforce reduced employment and other costs, such as business travel and some upcoming off-sites, according to an internal memo. The corporation did not explain the budget cuts. The past six months have seen an almost 50% decline in the stock price of Salesforce.

Meta

Mark Zuckerberg assured employees at an internal all-hands that job cuts are not planned. Still, Meta is perhaps the biggest company to have announced a hiring freeze for certain roles as it works to control its spending amid an “industry-wide downturn.”

On June 30, Zuckerberg reportedly told employees the company to slash its hiring goals for engineers by at least 30% this year and warned them to brace for “one of the worst downturns that we’ve seen in recent history.” The hiring reductions will affect “almost every team across the company” and last for the rest of the year.

Spotify

Daniel Ek, the CEO of Spotify, informed staff via email that the company would reduce hiring goals by 25%. Before this, CFO Paul Vogel stated that the company would evaluate headcount soon and is “clearly aware of the increasing uncertainty regarding the global economy”

Google

Following word that it would slow hiring and spending through the rest of the year, Alphabet-owned Google informed staff on July 20 that it is stopping hiring for two weeks. According to senior VP Prabhakar Raghavan, the hold won’t affect existing offers, but the business won’t make any new ones until the pause is through.

Will tech layoffs continue?

Over the past ten years, tech companies have experienced rapid expansion and exorbitant spending. However, given the impending global recession, which might be significantly longer and harsher than many think, Silicon Valley companies that announced large layoffs this week could be a leading indicator for the economy.

Tech companies may need to slow down their recent expansion and spending boom in favor of cost-cutting measures when possible due to the changing economic climate.
