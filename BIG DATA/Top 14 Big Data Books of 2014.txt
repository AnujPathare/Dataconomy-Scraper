2. The Big Data-Driven Business: How to Use Big Data to Win Customers, Beat Competitors, and Boost Profits by Russell Glass & Sean Callahan

A complaint we hear time and time again is that companies have plentiful data, but no idea how to use it.

Filled with examples of how businesses are using the data to outshine the competition- and cautionary tales about ignoring the insights at your fingertips- this book is a must-have guide for those looking to infuse data into their business practices.
