Article:
We live in a world of 1’s and 0’s, a world of data. Consumers and businesses send and receive enormous amounts of data all day, every day. From smartphones that learn how the user behaves to purchasing decisions that inform marketing messaging to analytics that can isolate flaws in a supply chain — Big Data is powering business today.

That’s why Big Data literacy is becoming a highly sought-after skill among hiring managers and recruiters. According to one study, nearly 70 per cent of employers expect to favour candidates with serious data science chops over candidates lacking that skill set.

Simply getting an MBA degree might not be enough today. Future-proofing your education means making sure you’re equipped with a solid foundation in Big Data, data science, machine learning and automation. While many institutions haven’t exactly been on the forefront of change, most prestigious business schools are beginning to embrace the potential of Big Data.

We analyzed a total of 16 prestige programs, the ones largely considered the best of the best. Some of these are Ivy League programs and some aren’t. Most are in the United States, though two of them are in the UK. We looked at more than 160 courses among those 16 schools.

What we found was that the bulk of schools don’t yet require a great deal of Big Data education for their MBA students.

In fact, just one school required more than two courses, and two-thirds of schools require just one class on data science. Only one school we looked at offers more than 30 classes between core and electives in data science, and more than half don’t crack the double digits.

Several schools do offer special programs or immersive experiences, and each of them does at least provide a foundation in Big Data.

Not all courses are offered during each term. We’ve looked at the most recent academic term for which class listings are publicly available at each institution. In most cases, that was fall 2018, though some courses listed are for future or past terms.

Stanford University

Santa Clara County, California

Stanford Graduate School of Business

With its close proximity to the heart of the tech world, Silicon Valley, it’s no wonder that Stanford has by far the most robust MBA offerings focusing on Big Data, data science, machine learning and automation among the dozen-plus prestige MBA programs we studied. While offering only one required course in Big Data, Stanford Graduate School of Business lists an incredible 30 elective courses to help business students build their skill set in data analysis. With literally hundreds of companies applying those principles on a daily basis just a few minutes from their campus, Stanford’s students are uniquely positioned to take on the future of business.
