The event’s tagline, “scary fast”, hints not only at the imminent introduction of Apple’s advanced M3 silicon chip but also playfully alludes to Halloween. Amidst dwindling Mac sales this year, the tech giant is anticipated to unveil new iMac models equipped with this robust chipset.

The event’s promotional page on Apple’s website showcases the Apple logo morphing into the Finder icon, reinforcing rumors of new Mac releases. Additionally, a recent report by Bloomberg‘s Mark Gurman suggests Apple might surprise fans with a Mac-focused product launch during this event.

Buzz is building around Apple’s upcoming Scary Fast event, with speculations pointing towards the unveiling of a revamped 24-inch iMac and a novel MacBook Pro. Gurman’s reports highlight dwindling stocks of the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros and the iMac, hinting at the imminent launch of new versions.

The anticipated computers might be powered by Apple’s M3 chip, aligning with the event’s Scary Fast theme, suggesting enhanced speed and performance. While Apple usually announces new iPads in October, insights from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo indicate potential iPad updates might be postponed to next year.

Just last month, Apple showcased its “Wonderlust” event, introducing the iPhone 15 series, Apple Watch updates, and the AirPods Pro with a USB-C charger.

Additionally, a more affordable USB-C-compatible Apple Pencil was revealed recently. As the event date approaches, Apple enthusiasts are eagerly awaiting the tech giant’s next big reveal.

Apple’s transition to its proprietary chips continues to make headlines. After introducing the M2 chip to the MacBook range last year, the tech giant is anticipated to upgrade the 24-inch iMac with the M3 chip at this year’s Scary Fast event. As of now, there’s no buzz surrounding a new iPad release.

In 2020, Apple made a significant shift by launching its in-house M1 silicon chipset for computers, moving away from the long-standing reliance on Intel. Apple touted it as the globe’s swiftest CPU core with unparalleled integrated graphics for PCs.
