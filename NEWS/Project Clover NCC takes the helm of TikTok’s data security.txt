Leveraging NCC Group’s cybersecurity expertise and certifications, TikTok is focusing on strengthening data controls and protections, including the inauguration of a Dublin data center and real-time security monitoring. What’s next: TikTok and NCC Group will engage with European policymakers to further clarify Project Clover’s aims and operations, as the initiative takes on increased importance amid growing scrutiny from legislators in Europe and the U.S. over data security.

Project Clover spearheads TikTok’s latest efforts to enhance data security by bringing in the UK-based NCC cybersecurity firm for independent auditing and verification of its data safeguards.

Project Clover is based in Dublin

To further secure European users’ information, TikTok has inaugurated a state-of-the-art data center in Dublin, Ireland, where migration of user data is currently in progress. Additional data centers in Norway and another in Ireland are in the pipeline for construction.

NCC Group’s role and credentials

Project Clover enlists the expertise of NCC Group, a highly regarded European cybersecurity firm, for an independent review of TikTok’s data control measures. NCC Group will also monitor data activity, certify its protection protocols, and report on security incidents.

Boasting TIBER-EU accreditation and UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) approval, the company has a multinational presence, including locations in Germany, Portugal, the Netherlands, Spain, Denmark, and the UK. Teams from multiple European branches, as well as the UK, will collaborate on this critical security endeavor.

Security measures

As the oversight authority in Project Clover, NCC Group has been tasked with meticulously monitoring data traffic to confirm that only authorized personnel have access to restricted types of data. This includes continuous assessments of the advanced security perimeters TikTok is constructing around its European user data, the TikTok app, and its associated data centers and infrastructure.

NCC Group also operates as the managed security services provider for TikTok’s security gateways. Their role includes real-time scrutiny to detect and counter any unusual or suspicious access attempts. They also certify the robustness of the enhanced security measures that are in place.

Building trust in IoT ecosystems: A privacy-enhancing approach to cybersecurity

The purpose of these multi-layered controls is to secure the data of European users within a purpose-built, secure environment. This ecosystem is further reinforced by strict independent verification and oversight, ensuring that only approved employees can access this sensitive information.

Upcoming engagements and future plans

In the upcoming months, TikTok and NCC Group plan to engage with European policymakers to elaborate on the operational details of Project Clover.

We’re proud that TikTok has recognised NCC’s cyber security track record and expertise and chosen us as the independent third-party security provider on this project. Our objective scrutiny, monitoring and assurance means platform users in Europe and the UK can have confidence in the enhanced data security standards that TikTok is setting, which go above and beyond European regulatory requirements. -Stephen Bailey, Global Director of Privacy at NCC Group

The announcement of Project Clover came in March, responding to intensifying scrutiny from legislative bodies in both Europe and the United States concerning data security issues.
