ChatGPT: The new co-pilot for DS Automobiles drivers

ChatGPT, the talk of the tech town, is an AI marvel that understands and generates human-like conversations. The same technology has become a part of our laptops, PCs, and even smartphones. But DS Automobiles is taking it one step further by incorporating it into their DS IRIS SYSTEM.

With ChatGPT on board, DS vehicles transform into conversational companions. Similar to the voice command systems you find in many modern cars, you can speak to your car. However, the difference lies in the depth and breadth of responses. ChatGPT-powered DS cars have a digital assistant that can answer various questions, making your drive smarter and more engaging. All it takes is a simple “OK IRIS” or a button press on the steering wheel to start a safe and seamless conversation without diverting your attention from the road.

The automotive landscape is changing rapidly as technology reshapes our everyday lives. DS Automobiles, a subsidiary of Stellantis, is breaking new ground by introducing ChatGPT, a versatile AI, into their vehicles, promising a more interactive and intelligent driving experience.

The DS IRIS SYSTEM, now equipped with ChatGPT, allows drivers to converse with their vehicles. Whether you’re seeking local tourist spots, asking for art recommendations, creating quizzes, or crafting stories, the AI chatbot is there to assist, making every drive more interactive.

Olivier François, Head of DS Automobiles, shared his thoughts on this exciting integration:

”Our mission at DS is to provide our customers with a unique onboard experience. As pioneers in integrating ChatGPT into the automotive world, we are making a generative artificial intelligence that is fluid, intuitive, immersive accessible, transforming every trip into a unique journey. It is a high-tech revolution with unlimited potential and one of the greatest 21st-century societal transformations”.

Beyond car talk

The possibilities with ChatGPT in DS vehicles are as wide as your imagination. You can ask for local recommendations, seek insights into the world’s art treasures, create custom quizzes, or even weave captivating children’s stories with your AI co-pilot. DS Automobiles aims to revolutionize in-car interactions, offering a new way to communicate with your vehicle.

Olivier François, Head of DS Automobiles, envisions an unparalleled customer onboard experience. By embracing ChatGPT, DS is pioneering a new era in AI integration, making it user-friendly and immersive.

Starting the “Pilot” phase

To gather feedback from customers and fine-tune the experience, DS Automobiles is launching a pilot phase. During this limited period, the integration of the chatbot with the DS IRIS SYSTEM is being offered to the first 20,000 subscribers at no additional cost, courtesy of “SoundHound AI powered by ChatGPT.”

This groundbreaking technology may soon expand its horizons to other brands under the Stellantis group, potentially changing how we interact with vehicles globally. DS Automobiles stands at the forefront of this 21st-century transformation, and the future of driving looks brighter than ever.
