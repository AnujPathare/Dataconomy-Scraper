According to the leaked Google Pay data, the black staff at the company make $20k less than white employees, and also gender pay gap is still an issue.

An internal spreadsheet shared among Google employees provides detailed information on the salaries and bonuses of over 12,000 U.S. employees in various roles, including software engineers, business analysts, and salespeople. The data covers the year 2022 and was voluntarily submitted by employees.

The leaked salary data from Google reveals that employees with longer tenure with the company and who held higher-level positions tended to have higher salaries. For instance, the highest reported base salary was for a level 7 software engineer, earning $718,000 in base salary and a total compensation package of nearly $800,000. Some other high-level software engineers reported total compensation packages exceeding $1 million due to substantial bonus and equity components.

Among software engineers, the majority reported base salaries ranging from $100,000 to $375,000. Let’s move on to other important points made after the leaked Google Pay data went public.

Leaked Google Pay data revealed differences between salaries

The leaked data from Google reveals significant disparities in pay, with black employees earning an average of $20,000 less than their white colleagues. Additionally, women are consistently paid less than men across various departments within the company.

This data comes from spreadsheets detailing the salaries and bonuses of over 12,000 Google employees in white-collar positions across its US offices. These findings indicate that Google may not be fully upholding the equity component of its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) policy, with evident patterns of unequal pay based on race and gender.

While the leaked salary data from Google does highlight disparities in pay based on race and gender, it also reveals some exceptions to corporate stereotypes. For instance, women working on Google’s sales team earn more on average than their male counterparts.

However, it’s worth noting that Google’s average “minimum base salary” is relatively low in some of the most expensive areas to live in the United States, such as New York City and Silicon Valley. In New York City, the reported average “minimum base salary” is $48,000, which may be insufficient to cover living expenses in the city in 2023.

How does Google’s pay system work?

According to Insider, Google utilizes a level system to determine the pay grades and responsibilities of its employees. Generally, a higher level corresponds to higher pay and greater expectations. The level scale ranges from 0 (for interns) to 10, with rare cases like Jeff Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat reaching the esteemed “senior fellow” level 11 position.

Google, like many tech companies, adjusts salaries to align with the cost of living in various locations. Salaries are typically higher in areas such as the Bay Area and New York, while they may be lower in places like Colorado and Georgia. However, there can be exceptions to this general trend.

According to Google’s most recent diversity report from 2022, the company’s US workforce consisted of 33.9% women and 66.1% men.

The leaked data not only offers valuable insights into technical positions at Google but also reveals details about the compensation structure for sales and business roles within the company. These roles are instrumental in generating revenue and facilitating Google’s growth and expansion.

Although the leaked data doesn’t provide specific figures for salaries in sales and business positions, it is clear that Google places a high value on the contributions of professionals in these domains. As a result, the company offers competitive base salaries to reward employees in these roles appropriately.
