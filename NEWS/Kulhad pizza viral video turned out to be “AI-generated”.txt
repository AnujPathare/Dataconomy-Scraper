The recent Kulhad pizza viral video has surfaced online, and the owner said it is “AI-generated” and not genuine. This is one of the most clear examples of the dangers of artificial intelligence.

The owner of Kulhad Pizza, a beloved Indian eatery based in Jalandhar, Punjab, found himself at the center of a peculiar and disturbing controversy. A viral video initially believed to feature the owner and his wife in compromising circumstances has turned out to be a fake, according to a statement issued by Sehaj, the restaurant’s proprietor. This incident has shed light on the sinister world of online scams and digital deception, serving as a cautionary tale for all of us in the digital age.

What is the Kulhad pizza viral video?

Sehaj, the owner of Kulhad Pizza, recently found himself ensnared in a web of deceit when he received an unsolicited and inappropriate video in his Instagram direct messages (DMs). The video purportedly depicted a random couple, but the scammers behind it had a nefarious agenda. They threatened to expose the video, claiming it featured Sehaj and his wife unless he met their demands for payment. Disturbed by this vile attempt at extortion, Sehaj took immediate action by contacting the local police and filing a First Information Report (FIR).

However, despite his efforts to seek legal recourse, Sehaj’s plea fell on deaf ears as the video soon surfaced on the internet, going viral within days. The clip not only garnered unwarranted attention but also raised questions about the authenticity of the content, with speculations of AI-generated alterations to the faces involved. It was a distressing ordeal that Sehaj was determined to set right.

The restaurant owner’s emotional appeal

In the face of this harrowing ordeal, Sehaj stepped forward to address the public, fervently declaring the video as unequivocally “fake.” He implored social media users not to share it, highlighting the potential repercussions it could have on his family and marriage. A recent addition to his family made this situation even more unbearable, as the video allegedly featured his wife, who was unaware of its existence.

Sehaj’s emotional plea underscored the profound impact such online scams can have on individuals and their loved ones. His determination to have the video removed through legal means serves as a testament to the resilience of individuals confronting digital deception in the modern age. This incident is a stark reminder that in the digital world, vigilance and support from the community are essential to combatting scams and false representations that can tarnish lives and reputations.

This development underscores the seriousness with which law enforcement authorities are treating such incidents and their commitment to bringing the culprits to justice.

Dangers of AI
