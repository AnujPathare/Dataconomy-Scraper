According to the latest news of Insider, VMware has decided on employee fates. The VMware leaked email shows every option the employees have right now.

VMware employees have found themselves at the center of attention due to a leaked internal email that discloses the potential outcomes they might face once Broadcom’s massive $61 billion acquisition of the cloud computing and virtualization giant reaches its anticipated conclusion. This revelation, shedding light on the fate of thousands of VMware workers, is paramount in the tech world, leaving employees and industry experts on the edge of their seats.

VMware CEO Raghu Raghuram and Chief People Officer Betsy Sutter left no stone unturned in ensuring their workforce is informed about the impending acquisition. They hosted a meeting with senior directors, during which crucial updates about the acquisition, slated to close its doors on October 30th, were shared. Insider, a reliable source of insider information, got a sneak peek at an email dispatched to senior managers outlining the details.

What does the VMware leaked email say?

According to Insider, the email in question clearly shows the potential scenarios in which VMware employees may find themselves as the acquisition unfolds. Three possible outcomes are on the horizon: receiving a Broadcom job offer, being presented with a transitional role offer, or facing the prospect of a severance package. However, the decision-making process regarding these options does not seem to lie in the hands of the employees’ hands.

It is essential to underscore that this fate is not something that individual employees, including managers, can handpick. Furthermore, the email drops another bombshell by revealing that managers are unlikely to receive any forewarning about the future status of either themselves or their teams. Uncertainty looms over the VMware workforce, and the lack of control over their destiny has made employees understandably apprehensive.

Here is the VMware leaked email obtained from Insider, showing what options the employees have:

There will be three possible options for current VMware employees:

1) Receive a Broadcom offer

2) Receive a transitional role offer – this can vary brd on role, but will involve a set amount of additional months to be retained before their severance package starts. These will be few in number

3) Receive a severance package brd on VMware’s severance plan.

Please note that most employees are unlikely to have the ability to choose which of these three options they will be presented with.

The target for notifying employees of their status is mid-late October, but it could be later or even after close. As well, some countries outside of the US have guidelines which may affect the notification date. This means individuals in different countries may receive their notifications at different times.

Managers will be treated the same as other employees and are generally unlikely to know the status of themselves or their team members in advance.

In an attempt to maintain transparency amidst these significant changes, VMware has set a timeline for notifying employees of their employment status. The email indicates that employees can expect to receive this crucial information by mid to late October. Nevertheless, due to the complex nature of the acquisition, there exists a possibility that notifications may be delayed, possibly extending beyond the acquisition’s official closure.

While these developments may bring forth a certain degree of trepidation, it is worth noting that the tech industry is known for its resilience and adaptability. Despite facing an uncertain future, employees can leverage their skills and expertise in this ever-evolving field. As the acquisition unfolds, the tech community will closely watch VMware and Broadcom, hoping for a smooth transition that benefits all stakeholders.
