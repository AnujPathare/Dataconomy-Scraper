The Flipper Zero community is excited as the ‘Xtreme’ custom firmware introduces a new capability: Bluetooth spam attacks on Android and Windows devices. Inspired by a security researcher’s similar feat on Apple iOS devices, this development sheds light on the untapped potential of Flipper Zero. These spam attacks utilize Flipper Zero’s wireless capabilities to send out fake advertising packets to devices within range, overwhelming them with pairing and connection requests.

Flipper Zero firmware: Xtreme

The Flipper Xtreme community recently announced a major addition to their firmware: “spam attacks.” They even demonstrated via their Discord channel that these attacks can create chaos by rendering a Samsung Galaxy device unusable. Although the latest firmware is still in development, the “spam attack” is now accessible through an application called ‘BLE Spam,’ available on GitHub.

According to Bleeping Computer, prominent YouTuber ‘Talking Sasquach’ took the development firmware for a spin on his Flipper Zero and confirmed that the attack works seamlessly on both Windows and Android platforms. The BLE Spam app offers users eight distinct flood attack options, enabling various applications.

These options include overwhelming devices with notifications like ‘Every method combined,’ ‘iOS 17 Lockup Crash,’ ‘Apple Action Modal,’ ‘Apple Device popup,’ ‘Android device pair,’ and ‘Windows Device Found.’ Once initiated, Flipper Zero continuously sends out Bluetooth packets, resulting in constant connectivity prompts and notifications on nearby devices.

How to defend against spam attacks

While these spam attacks are more of an annoyance than a serious threat, it’s essential to be aware of their potential to evolve into more sophisticated and misleading forms, possibly aiding in social engineering or other malicious activities. Notably, Android 14 and Windows 11 devices, by default, display notifications when receiving Bluetooth connection requests, making them susceptible to Flipper Zero attacks. Thankfully, there’s a straightforward way to block these notifications on both systems.

For Android Users:

Open the ‘Settings’ menu. Go to ‘Google.’ Select ‘Nearby Share.’ Toggle the ‘Show notification’ option to the “Off” position.

Alternatively, you can access the same menu through ‘Settings’ → ‘Connected Devices’ → ‘Connection preferences’ → ‘Nearby Share.’

For Windows Users:

Access ‘Settings.’ Select ‘Bluetooth & devices’ from the menu on the left. Click on ‘Devices.’ Scroll down to ‘Device settings.’ Toggle the ‘Show notifications to connect using Swift Pair’ option to the “Off” position.
