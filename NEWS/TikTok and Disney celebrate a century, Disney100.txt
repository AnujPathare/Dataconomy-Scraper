Starting October 16, in commemoration of Disney’s centennial, TikTok is offering its vast community of Disney aficionados a distinctive destination within the platform. This space allows fans to immerse themselves in a magical interactive experience where they can relive stories and memories. They can view videos from a range of Disney’s brands, craft their own videos using Disney-themed music and effects, participate in daily Disney trivia, and even collect and trade “Character Cards” of their beloved characters. Successful trades reward fans with special profile frames to flaunt their Disney passion.

Nicole Iacopetti, TikTok’s Global Head of Content, expressed her excitement about this partnership, emphasizing Disney’s long-standing legacy of spreading joy through its iconic content. She mentioned, “We’re thrilled to partner with Disney to celebrate the company’s undeniable impact on entertainment and on families around the world, starting by giving TikTok’s passionate community of Disney fans unique access to content and experiences they can’t find anywhere else.”

Echoing her sentiments, Asad Ayaz, Chief Brand Officer of The Walt Disney Company, highlighted Disney’s century-long leadership in creative innovation and storytelling. He noted the immense engagement Disney content has garnered on TikTok, with over 240 billion views spanning Disney’s diverse portfolio. He added, “TikTok has become a go-to destination for Disney fans to create, engage and connect around their favorite Disney films, shows, characters and experiences, so we’re thrilled to partner with them as we celebrate the 100th anniversary of the company.”

The four-week Disney100 activation on TikTok will be accessible in 24 regions worldwide, underscoring the vast content range of The Walt Disney Company. Whether fans are reminiscing about legacy films, celebrating heroes from the Marvel universe, or newer classics like Encanto, they turn to TikTok to connect and craft entertaining content that underscores the unique Disney experience on the platform. This creativity is evident as over 150 million followers of Disney-operated TikTok accounts regularly engage with content, from thrilling moments on ESPN to educational insights from National Geographic.

In addition to the Disney100 hub, Disney is set to become a TikTok Pulse Premiere publisher. This move allows advertisers to position their ads alongside some of the most premium entertainment and sports content exclusively from Disney on TikTok’s For You feed.

TikTok: Not just another app
