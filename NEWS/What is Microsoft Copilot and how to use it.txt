Microsoft Copilot is like having a smart, digital sidekick for your Microsoft world. It’s an AI assistant that works across Microsoft applications such as Microsoft 365, Windows 11, Edge, and Bing. Its job is to make your life easier by helping out with different tasks you do on these apps.

For instance, if you’re using Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, or Teams, Copilot steps in to lend a hand. It can do things like writing text in Word, suggesting email content in Outlook, and even creating visual graphs in Excel using Python. Windows 11 spices up usual features like copy/paste, Snipping Tool, and personalization, aiming to simplify your daily tasks.

Bing Chat is part of Copilot, and this combo helps answer all sorts of questions. From simple things like knowing the time in a different country to planning a full trip with flights and places to stay, Copilot is there to assist. But it’s not perfect yet; there have been some issues where it doesn’t fully understand what users want.

What is Microsoft Copilot?

Microsoft Copilot is a smarter replacement for the classic Microsoft Office assistant, offering support across Microsoft’s suite of apps like Teams, Outlook, PowerPoint, and Word. Whether you’re wrangling data in Excel or trying to stay on top of your inbox, Copilot is there to lighten the load.

Microsoft showcased Copilot’s impressive abilities, including its knack for summarizing long email threads and sifting through heaps of spreadsheet data. This feature fuses Bing Chat and other plugins into a sidebar, marking a new era in PC assistance. Copilot doesn’t just stop at the basics; it enhances existing functions like copy/paste and the Snipping Tool. It can even help rephrase or summarize content you copy and paste.

With Bing Chat on board, Copilot can handle a wide range of inquiries, from checking the local time to planning a trip, finding flights, and accommodations. A standout demonstration of Copilot’s capabilities is its use in Excel. It’s a powerful tool for analyzing data, identifying trends, creating new sheets and graphs, and explaining how it reached those conclusions.
