Quest 3

The Meta Quest 3, the upgraded version of the well-liked Quest 2 VR headset, was the main attraction at Meta Connect 2023. With a cutting-edge Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 CPU from Qualcomm and a sizable 8GB of RAM, this new smartphone has significant power. Users will experience VR more smoothly and completely as a result.

But the Quest 3’s “passthrough” function is what really makes it stand out. This clever feature enhances the sensation of presence and lessens the detached feeling frequently tied to VR by allowing you to see your actual surroundings without taking off the headset. This function is extremely user-friendly because a double tap on the headset activates it.

The Quest 3 excels in terms of graphics as well. The “Infinite Display” it uses has a resolution of 2064 x 2208 per eye across two displays. This results in a 30% improvement in visual clarity over the Quest 2. It is the clearest display in the Quest family, measuring 25 pixels per degree and 1,218 pixels per inch.

The Quest 3’s pricing is also appealing, beginning at $649.99 for the 512GB variant and $499.99 for the 128GB model. On the official Meta Quest website, both are up for pre-order, ushering in a new age of VR entertainment.

Meta AI

Another notable aspect of the event is Meta AI Assistant. With Meta Quest 3, Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, and other Meta platforms, this AI helper works without a hitch. It’s your virtual ally, here to help with chores, respond to inquiries, and improve your online experience.

Meta Trip planning and real-time online results via Microsoft’s Bing are only two examples of the huge possibilities of AI. It will change the way we communicate with technology.

Emu

The game will alter when it comes to producing and engaging with visual material thanks to Emu, Meta’s picture production AI. Realistic visuals and films may be created from text descriptions using this technique. Restyle and Backdrop, two new features powered by Emu, are coming to Instagram.

Using Meta’s Segment Anything Model, “Backdrop” aims to transform how we utilize images on social media. Emu expands the creative options available to both consumers and content producers.

Ray-Ban Smart Glasses

These fashionable glasses will boost your augmented reality encounters’ enhanced audio and camera capabilities.
