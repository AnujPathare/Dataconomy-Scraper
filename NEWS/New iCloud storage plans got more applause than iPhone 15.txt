New iCloud storage plans: Photographers and filmmakers rejoice

New iCloud storage plans, boasting a whopping 6 terabytes and an astonishing 12 terabytes of storage, have sent ripples of excitement through the tech community. While the average user may not require such colossal storage capacity, these plans are poised to be a game-changer for creative professionals, particularly photographers and filmmakers.

Apple’s decision to enhance its cloud storage offerings coincides with the significant camera upgrades featured in the iPhone 15, making it a match made in tech heaven for content creators. With the ability to capture high-resolution photos and videos, creative individuals can now securely store their work without the constraints of limited storage.

Pricing that makes sense

Apple’s existing iCloud+ subscription plans offer 50 GB for $0.99 per month, 200 GB for $2.99 per month, and 2 TB for $9.99 per month. Based on this pricing structure, industry experts speculate that the new 6 TB and 12 TB subscriptions will be available at a maximum cost of $30 and $60 per month, respectively. This pricing aligns closely with Google’s cloud storage options, where 5 TB and 10 TB plans are offered at $24.99 and $49.99 per month, respectively. This competitive pricing ensures that Apple remains in the same league as its tech counterparts.
