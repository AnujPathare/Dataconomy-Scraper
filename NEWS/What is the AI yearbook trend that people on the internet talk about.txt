What is the AI Yearbook trend?

The AI yearbook craze is all about reliving the 1990s with AI-generated high school yearbook images. It has become a viral phenomenon, with tens of thousands of people uploading their AI-enhanced vintage photographs on major sites such as TikTok and Instagram.

The Epik picture program, well known for its K-idol effect, is at the forefront of this trend. This software uses artificial intelligence to convert ordinary images into traditional yearbook-style masterpieces automatically. It goes beyond aesthetics by enhancing your images’ cosmetics, haircuts, clothing, frames, facial expressions, and more, giving them a genuine bygone vibe.

Furthermore, the AI software provides capabilities to beautify your skin by erasing blemishes and even deleting undesired aspects from your images such as people, objects, or animals.

This broad set of photographs provides the AI algorithm with a large amount of data to work with, resulting in a well-rounded and individualized yearbook photo. Specify Your Gender: You may tailor the AI’s modifications to your gender. This guarantees that the finished image not only emanates antique charm but also corresponds to your tastes. Hit the button: Click the “Create Yearbook Images” button to begin the yearbook creation process. This causes the app to begin the makeover process, which includes styling features reminiscent of traditional yearbook photographs. Select and Refine Your Photo: Once you’ve completed the first change, go through the results and choose a photo that speaks to you. This acts as your canvas, which you may further customize using filters, frames, backdrops, and other elements to add a unique touch. Finalize with a Click: Once you’re satisfied with your changes, click “Process.” This completes the metamorphosis, leaving you with a one-of-a-kind AI-generated yearbook photo that encapsulates the spirit of the ’90s.
