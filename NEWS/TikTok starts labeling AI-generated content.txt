With Artificial Intelligence (AI) becoming an integral part of content creation, platforms like TikTok are stepping up to ensure responsible and transparent practices. Today, TikTok is introducing a new tool that empowers creators to label their AI-generated content, reinforcing its commitment to media literacy and responsible innovation.

AI is a game-changer for creators, offering them unparalleled opportunities to unleash their imagination. However, the power of AI also comes with the potential to confuse or mislead viewers if they are unaware that the content was generated or altered by AI. TikTok’s solution? A new tool that allows creators to clearly and easily label their AI-generated content.

This innovative label not only helps creators showcase the technology behind their content but also assists them in complying with TikTok’s Community Guidelines’ synthetic media policy. Introduced earlier this year, this policy mandates the labeling of AI-generated content containing realistic images, audio, or video. Creators can now use the new label or other forms of disclosure like stickers or captions to provide vital context to viewers.

To ensure that both creators and viewers understand how and why to use these labels, TikTok is releasing educational videos and resources in the coming weeks. These labels are poised to become essential tools, much like verified account badges and branded content labels, for sharing and contextualizing content within the TikTok community.

Testing automated AI-generated content labels

TikTok is pioneering the automatic labeling of AI-generated content. Starting this week, TikTok is testing an “AI-generated” label that will eventually be applied automatically to content detected as edited or created with AI. To enhance clarity around AI-powered TikTok products, TikTok AI effects will now explicitly include “AI” in their name and corresponding effects label. Guidelines for Effect House creators will also be updated accordingly.

These efforts are designed to build on existing content disclosures, such as TikTok effects labels, and provide a clear, intuitive, and nuanced way to inform the TikTok community about AI-generated content.

TikTok recognizes the importance of collaboration in navigating the AI landscape responsibly. The platform consulted its Safety Advisory Councils and sought the expertise of renowned industry professionals, including MIT’s Dr. David G. Rand. Dr. Rand’s research has been instrumental in shaping TikTok’s “AI-generated labels.” His findings have shown that the term “AI generated” is widely understood across diverse demographic groups as referring to content generated by AI.

TikTok continues to collaborate closely with peers, experts, and civil society within the industry. The platform’s commitment to responsible AI practices is evident through its participation in the Partnership on AI’s Responsible Practices for Synthetic Media and its partnerships with organizations like Digital Moment, where young community members share their insights on AI advancement online.

Navigating AI as it evolves

AI-generated content is an exciting frontier, and TikTok is committed to evolving alongside it. The platform will continue to iterate and assess the impact of these updates while working hand in hand with its community to navigate the ever-evolving world of AI-generated content safely.
